# Word Play Norwegian Mod

This repository contains a custom Norwegian dictionary and letter bag mod for the game **Word Play** by Game Maker's Toolkit.

---

## About

Word Play is designed primarily for English, with its dictionary and letter bag balanced around English word properties.

This mod enables playing **Word Play** in Norwegian by providing:

- A **custom Norwegian dictionary** based on the official word list from [Norsk Scrabbleforbund](https://www2.scrabbleforbundet.no/?p=4939)
- A **custom letter bag** with tile values and distributions from Norwegian Scrabble rules

> **Note:** This is an experimental and unsupported feature in Word Play. Use at your own risk.
